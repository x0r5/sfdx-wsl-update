# Just make the script executeable and run it
`chmod +x update_sfdx_manually`
`./update_sfdx_manually`

If you don't want to install it automatically, just choose the second option in the end.

This script is made for WSL2 so you can easily update sfdx cli if the `sfdx updte` command is not working.
`sfdx-cli: Updating CLI... !
